# Repository Instructions

## Application source

The production application source lives in `src/`. Runtime code must be implemented from project source and npm dependencies, not copied from reference snapshots.

## Reference-only Material Web source

The `references/` folder is preview/research only. It contains external open-source Material Web source code for comparison, documentation, and AI context.

Rules for `references/`:

- Do not edit files under `references/`.
- Do not import, bundle, or execute code from `references/`.
- Do not copy reference code blindly into application source.
- Use the folder only to inspect implementation patterns and component APIs.
- Consume Material Web components through npm imports from `@material/web` when the package is available to the project.

## Material Web imports

Keep Material Web custom element registration centralized in `src/core/material/MaterialElements.ts` unless there is a strong reason to add a separate import boundary.

## Material Web styling

Do not override Material Web component structure, sizing, shape, padding, borders, typography, cursor, ripple, icon placement, disabled behavior, or animation in application SCSS. Prefer component attributes and slots, and limit CSS customization on Material Web components to supported color/design tokens unless a documented accessibility or layout exception is required.

## Feature structure

Keep template examples generic and rename-friendly. New example functionality should live under `src/features/example-feature/` unless it is truly app-wide infrastructure.

- `domain/` holds small models and use cases.
- `presentation/` holds web components, HTML templates, and SCSS.
- Add `data/` only when the feature needs a repository, API adapter, DTO, mapper, or persistence example.
